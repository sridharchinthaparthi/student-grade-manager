## Features

- **Student Data Entry**: Add multiple students with roll numbers and marks
- **Automatic Grade Calculation**: Calculates total, average, percentage, and letter grades
- **Pass/Fail Status**: Automatically determines student status based on percentage
- **Class Statistics**: 
  - Total pass/fail count
  - Class average percentage
  - Highest and lowest scores
- **Top Performers List**: Displays top 3 students ranked by percentage
- **Subject-wise Analysis**: Shows average marks for each subject
- **Search Functionality**: Find students by name or roll number
- **Clean Reports**: Formatted output for easy reading

## Grading System

| Percentage | Grade | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| 90% - 100% | A+ | Pass |
| 80% - 89% | A | Pass |
| 70% - 79% | B | Pass |
| 60% - 69% | C | Pass |
| 50% - 59% | D | Pass |
| 40% - 49% | E | Pass |
| Below 40% | F | Fail |

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10
- Built-in data structures (Lists, Dictionaries)
- String manipulation methods
- Sorting algorithms

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases proficiency in:
- **Variables & Data Types**: Integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries
- **Multi-variable Creation**: Managing multiple data points simultaneously
- **Inbuilt Methods**: String methods (strip, title, upper, lower), list methods (append, sum)
- **Indexing & Slicing**: Accessing and manipulating list elements
- **Copy Operations**: Creating independent copies of data structures
- **Typecasting**: Converting between integers, floats, and strings
- **Input/Output**: User interaction and formatted output
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- **Conditional Statements**: If-elif-else for grade assignment
- **Looping Statements**: For loops for iteration, nested loops for sorting
- **List Comprehension Concepts**: Data manipulation and filtering
